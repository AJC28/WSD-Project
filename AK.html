    <p> Born November 10, 1919,<strong> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Kalashnikov"> Mikhail Timofeyevich Kalashnikov</a> </strong> 
	    was conscripted in the Red Army at 19 years of age.  
	    There he became a tank driver as well as a mechanic, where he achieved the rank of senior 
	    sergent tank commander.  While he was interned in a hospital for wounds he'd received in combat, he overheard the other Russians
	    speaking ill of the Soviet rifles.  He then decided to design one himself, and thus the great creation of the famous AK-47. 
	    Commonly known as the Kalashnikov, he named it "Avtomat Kalashnikov"the first word meaning literally 
	    "machine that does not need human interference", and the second bearing his last name. 
	    The 47 was given because of the year it was finally finished in 1947. 
	    Probably one of the worlds most widely used assault rifles, it has seen combat many of times around the world. 
	    Because of its rugged design, and the many different mods it comes in, it has been reproduced in many countries.    </p>

	<h4> KNOCK OFFS  </h4>
	
	
	<p>  Since the design of the rifle was so successful, many countries started to reproduce them with the help of reverse 
	     engineering.  Though none of them had been produced with proper licensing from IZH, which is the Izhevsk Machine Tool 
	     Factory.  Only until recently in 1999 was a patent acquired, nevertheless it was too late as many countries ranging from 
	     India to Israel had produced many variants of the<span>  AK-47 in mass production</span> .  Because of the millions of types of AKs that
	     where counterfeited, they have been favored in many battles, even today we see them in the hands of the Taliban, Cartels, and 
	     many more.  It is estimated that there are 1000 million of the AK variants around the world, only of which 5 million are 
	     the originally manufactured in the former USSR. </p>

 	<p> Nonetheless the Kalashnikov has proved itself time and time again around the world, as a well 
 	    crafted assault rifle, with very little to worry about maintenance and ease of use.  And with the many
 	    modifications it has over-gone, it is constantly being glorified as one of the best rifles ever built.
 	    Happy shooting! </p>
