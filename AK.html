	<h1> THE CREATOR OF THE FAMOUS AK-47 <img src="../images/Ak 47.jpg">  </h1>
	
	
	

	<p> Born November 10, 1919, Mikhail Timofeyevich Kalashnikov was conscripted in the Red Army at 19 years of age.  
	    There he became a tank driver as well as a mechanic, where he achieved the rank of senior 
	    sergent tank commander.  While he was interned in a hospital for wounds he'd received in combat, he overheard the other Russians
	    speaking ill of the Soviet rifles.  He then decided to design one himself, and thus the great creation of the infamous AK-47. 
	    Commonly known as the Kalashnikov, he named it "Avtomat Kelashnikov" the first word meaning literally 
	    "machine that does not need human interference", and the second bearing his last name. 
	    The 47 was given because of the year it was finally finished 1947. 
	    Probably one of the worlds most widely used assault rifles, it has seen combat around the world. 
	    Because of its ruggad design, and the many different mods in comes in, it has been reproduced in many countries.    </p>
